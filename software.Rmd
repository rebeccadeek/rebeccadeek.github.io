## `zinLDA`

Zero-inflated latent Dirichlet allocation (zinLDA) is an unsupervised, hierarchical, generative probabilistic model that facilitates dimensionality reduction and detection of sparse latent clusters. This package, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/rebeccadeek/zinLDA), provides implementation of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling procedure for the zinLDA model. Additionally, it provides a method for simulating sparse count data from an underlying zinLDA model.

While the original [paper](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.602594) developed this model for applications to microbiome data and microbial subcommunity detection, it is designed to be portable to numerous types of discrete count data.
